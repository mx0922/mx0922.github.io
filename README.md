# Welcome to My Personal Homepage!

## About Me
I am [Xiang Meng (孟祥)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iQAvBl0AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW), and welcome to my GitHub page. I am a Ph.D. candicate in legged robotics in Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China. 
I received the B.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from BIT in 2019/06. From 2019/09, I started pursuring the Ph.D. degree with the Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronical Engineering, BIT. 
My research interests include motion generation and control for humanoid robots.

## My Projects
- [TrajOptim and MPC](https://github.com/mx0922/tutorials_trajOptim_MPC): A simple and light-weight tutorial for trajectory optimization (TO) and model predictive control (MPC).
- [MXSpatialDynLib](https://github.com/mx0922/tutorials_MXSpatialDynLib): An ultra-lightweight and user-friendly robot dynamics library, which includes solutions for kinematics, dynamics, centroidal dynamics, and various matrix computations, facilitating the research process of model-based motion planning and control for legged robots.

## Publications
- [Online Adaptive Motion Generation for Humanoid Locomotion on Non-Flat Terrain via Template Behavior Extension](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10305536): Efficient trajectory optimizer and an online nonlinear centroidal MPC to extend the optimized template behaviors.
